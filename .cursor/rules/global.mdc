# Response Marker Rule

IMPORTANT: Every AI response MUST start with exactly "[AI-RESPONSE]" (without quotes) on its own line before any other content.
This applies to ALL responses including code reviews, explanations, and general answers.

Example:

```text
[AI-RESPONSE]
Here is my analysis of your code...
```
